The documentation is not all correct\*
As it was first done for primary `API` to give rough idea we've added documentation which is generated by `Insomnia`

command that was used for creating documentation

```
npx insomnia-documenter --config Insomnia_2020-07-22.json --output documentation
```

To look into documentation go into `documentation` folder
run `npx serve`
